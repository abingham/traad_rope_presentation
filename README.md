traad_rope_presentation
=======================

A presentation on traad and rope.

This presentation is built using org-reveal, the emacs extention for
creating reveal.js presentations from org-mode documents. For best results, you'll need:

 * [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/)
 * [org-babel](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/)
 * [htmlize.el](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Htmlize)
 * [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

To create the reveal.js presentation from the org-file source, open the org file in emacs and run:

```
M-x org-reveal-export-to-html
```

or, to create the presentation and immediately open it in a browser:

```
M-x org-reveal-export-to-html-and-browse
```

Enjoy!
